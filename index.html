  <h1>Master Routine – Privacy & Consent Notice</h1>

  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 2025</p>

  <p>Master Routine is an Alexa skill designed to enhance your smart home automation by introducing intelligent conditional logic into your routines. Your privacy is important to us, and we take the protection of your personal data seriously.</p>

  <h2>What Information We Access</h2>

    <li>Your Alexa Smart Home devices (names, types, and capabilities)</li>
    <li>Device states (e.g., on/off) to evaluate your conditional routines</li>
    <li>Your Alexa User ID (for securely linking your routines and preferences)</li>
    <li>Custom routines you configure via the skill interface</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information above solely for the purpose of enabling and managing your routines. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Evaluating conditionals (e.g., if a light is on)</li>
    <li>Executing actions on your behalf (e.g., turn off a fan)</li>
    <li>Storing and refreshing your device list (every 24 hours)</li>
    <li>Resolving conflicts between overlapping routines</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Store and Protect Data</h2>
  <p>Some non-sensitive data (like device metadata and logs) may be securely stored in our backend to improve performance and functionality. We do not store passwords, credentials, or sensitive personal data. All communication is encrypted, and data is protected using industry-standard security practices.</p>
